# react digi-kala replication

trying to recreate digi-kala with react js technology using redux as state management.

looks are not too great, but the functionality is ok.
- you can login 
- pick items to your shopping cart that gets saved for each user seperately
- there is also an admin login, which allows you to add / remove items from menu
- you can add a new user and choose whethear he is admin or not yourself :)

things won't get saved since there's no back-end, but it'll stay in redux database until you refresh the page.

> **normal user:**  
> user: pooyan  
> pass: 1234

> **admin user:**  
> user: sanee   
> pass: 4321
